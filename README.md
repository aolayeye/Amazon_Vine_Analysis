# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
## Overview
This project is about analyzing Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products.
In this project, we will PySpark to perform the ETL process to extract a video games dataset, transform the data, connect to an AWS RDS instance, and load the transformed data into pgAdmin. Next, weâ€™ll use PySpark, Pandas, or SQL to determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members in the video games dataset.

#### Control Flow
1. Using PySpark extract the video games dataset from AWS S3 bucket
2. Transform the data
3. Connect to an AWS RDS instance, and load the transformed data into pgAdmin
4. Use PySpark, Pandas, or SQL to determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members in the video games dataset.
